# Project Standards and Guidelines

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow language-specific style guides (ESLint for JS/TS, Black for Python, etc.)
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Include meaningful comments for complex business logic
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all business logic functions
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario being tested

## Documentation Standards
- Update README.md for any significant changes
- Document API endpoints with clear examples
- Include setup and deployment instructions
- Maintain changelog for version releases
- Document architectural decisions in ADR format

## Security Practices
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

## Performance Guidelines
- Optimize database queries and avoid N+1 problems
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Use lazy loading for large datasets
- Monitor and profile performance regularly
- Consider scalability in architectural decisions
